those scripts are made for server for sorting anime series and season in a directory you can also use it to convert file in the right encode like x265

W.I.P

These project work with three main programs an uploader to a ftp server, a sorter to manage transfered files and a converter for file not in x265

Make sure the executables for the following libraries are accessible.

1. [HandbrakeCLI](https://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php) - to convert file , pls put it in converter directory

Installation
------------

Just download those scripts and change path if needed


if you want to encode file from another computer you will need to setup an ftp server and change path for txt file etc in ftp download directory

Usage
=====
put file in a directory and change path in file and then lauch with .bat file or whatever you can set scripts to lauch with ecrontab -e or in windows by task manager
you may need to create a custom handbrake preset or use the documentation for handbrakeCLI (I include my preset it gives great quality with small file encode in x265.

Those scripts are build for server uses however you can use them in personal computer.
